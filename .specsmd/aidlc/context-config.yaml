# Context Configuration
# Defines what context each agent should load on activation.
# Only Construction Agent requires context loading at this stage.

    on_missing_critical:
      action: warn
      message: |
        ⚠️ Project standards not found.

        The Construction Agent needs project standards to generate consistent code.
        Missing: {missing_files}

        Please run project initialization first:
        → Use Master Agent with 'project-init' skill

        Or continue without standards (code may be inconsistent).

  inception:
    description: "Inception Agent needs project type awareness for unit decomposition"
    required_context:
      - path: project.yaml
        purpose: "Project type for unit decomposition and bolt type defaults"
        critical: false

    optional_context:
      - path: standards/tech-stack.md
        purpose: "Technology context for realistic decomposition"

    on_missing_critical:
      action: continue
      message: |
        ℹ️ Project not initialized yet.

        The project.yaml file will be created during project-init.
        Inception can proceed without it (will use defaults).

  operations:
    description: "Operations Agent requires deployment context"
    required_context: []
    optional_context:
      - path: standards/system-architecture.md
        purpose: "Architecture for deployment decisions"

      - path: operations/deployment-config.md
        purpose: "Existing deployment configuration"
