# specsmd AI-DLC Quick Start Guide

Get started with AI-Driven Development Lifecycle in minutes.

---

## Installation

```bash
npx specsmd@latest install
```

The installer will:

1. Detect available agentic coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot)
2. Install agent definitions and skills
3. Set up the memory bank structure
4. Create slash commands for your tools

---

## Three-Phase Workflow

AI-DLC has three sequential phases, each with a specialized agent:

| Phase | Agent | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Inception** | Inception Agent | Capture intents, gather requirements, decompose into units |
| **Construction** | Construction Agent | Execute bolts (rapid iterations) to build code |
| **Operations** | Operations Agent | Deploy, verify, and monitor |

The **Master Agent** orchestrates everything and helps you navigate.

---

## Quick Start Flow

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

Open your AI coding tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) and type this command as a prompt:

```text
/specsmd-master-agent
```

Then type `project-init` or `init` when prompted.

This guides you through:

- **Project type selection** (full-stack, backend API, frontend, CLI, library)
- **Tech stack decisions** (language, framework, database, ORM)
- **Coding standards** (formatting, linting, testing strategy)
- **Optional standards** (architecture, UX guide, API conventions)

Standards are saved to `memory-bank/standards/` and provide context for all AI agents.

### Step 2: Create Your First Intent

Switch to the Inception Agent:

```text
/specsmd-inception-agent intent-create
```

An **Intent** is a high-level goal. Examples:

- "User authentication system"
- "Product catalog with search"
- "Payment processing integration"

The agent will:

1. Capture the intent
2. Elaborate requirements
3. Define system context
4. Decompose into units

### Step 3: Plan and Start Bolts

Once units are defined, plan your first bolt:

```text
/specsmd-inception-agent bolt-plan
```

A **Bolt** is a rapid iteration (hours to days). Two types available:

| Bolt Type | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **DDD Construction** | Complex business logic, domain modeling |
| **Simple Construction** | UI, integrations, utilities |

### Step 4: Execute Bolts

Switch to the Construction Agent to execute:

```text
/specsmd-construction-agent bolt-start
```

Each bolt type has its own stages:

**DDD Construction Bolt** (for complex business logic):

1. **Domain Model** - Model the business domain
2. **Technical Design** - Define interfaces and architecture
3. **ADR Analysis** - Document significant decisions (optional)
4. **Implement** - Write production code
5. **Test** - Verify correctness

**Simple Construction Bolt** (for UI, integrations, utilities):

1. **Spec** - Define what to build
2. **Implement** - Write the code
3. **Test** - Verify it works

Human validation happens at each stage.

### Step 5: Deploy

When bolts are complete, use the Operations Agent:

```text
/specsmd-operations-agent deploy
```

## Key Concepts

### Intent

A high-level statement of purpose. The starting point for AI-driven decomposition.

### Unit

A cohesive, self-contained work element derived from an Intent. Analogous to a Subdomain (DDD) or Epic (Scrum).

### Bolt

The smallest iteration in AI-DLC. Unlike Sprints (weeks), Bolts are hours to days. Two types: DDD Construction and Simple Construction.

### Memory Bank

File-based storage for all project artifacts. Maintains context across agent sessions.

### Standards

Project decisions that inform AI code generation (tech stack, coding style, architecture).

---

## Human Validation

AI-DLC emphasizes human oversight as a "loss function" - catching errors early.

**Key validation points:**

- After requirements elaboration
- After unit decomposition
- After story creation
- After each bolt stage
- Before deployment

Each validation step transforms artifacts into rich context for subsequent stages.

---

## Tips for Success

1. **Start with standards** - Project-init ensures AI agents understand your preferences
2. **Keep intents focused** - One major goal per intent
3. **Validate frequently** - Don't skip human checkpoints
4. **Use fresh chats** - Each agent invocation starts fresh; context comes from Memory Bank
5. **Trust the process** - AI-DLC is iterative; refinement happens naturally

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agents don't remember context

Agents are stateless. They read from Memory Bank at startup. Ensure artifacts are saved after each step.

### Standards not being followed

Re-run `project-init` to update standards. Agents load standards fresh each session.

### Reset project state

- Clear `memory-bank/` to reset artifacts
- Delete `.specsmd/` to uninstall specsmd

### Get help

```text
/specsmd-master-agent
# Then type: answer-question "your question here"
```

---

## What's Next?

1. Run `/specsmd-master-agent` and type `project-init` to set up your project
2. Create your first intent with `/specsmd-inception-agent intent-create`
3. Follow the guided workflow through Inception → Construction → Operations
